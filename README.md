# Shellcode_in_Remote_Process
To run the Rust code provided for injecting shellcode into a remote process on Windows, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Rust**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Rust on your system. You can download and install Rust from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Setup Rust Environment**: After installing Rust, make sure to set up your environment by running the following command in your PowerShell or command prompt:
rustup update && cargo update

3. **Copy the Code**: Copy the Rust code provided into a new file, let's say `main.rs`.

4. **Compile the Code**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `main.rs` is located, and run the following command to compile the Rust code:
cargo build --release

5. **Run the Executable**: After successful compilation, you'll find the compiled executable in the `target/release` directory. Run the executable from the command line and provide the PID of the target process as a command-line argument. For example:
./target/release/Shellcode_in_Remote_Process.exe <PID>

Replace `<PID>` with the actual Process ID (PID) of the target process where you want to inject the shellcode. Make sure to run this command with administrative privileges if required.

6. **Verify the Injection**: If the injection is successful, the shellcode will be executed within the target process, and you might observe the desired behavior depending on the shellcode's functionality.

Please note that running this code on your system may have unintended consequences if not used responsibly. Ensure that you have proper authorization and are not violating any laws or policies when injecting code into remote processes.
